# SASES Region IV Soil Judging	

Herein are archives of previous contests. 

## Getting Started

These sources are meant to serve the coaches. They are presented in Portable Document Format (pdf) as the document format was created for just such a purpose. No effort has been made to update the pdf's to newer encodings so the older versions may be less ADA accessible than the newer versions. Even so they are largely saved as pdf from Microsoft Word.

### Source access

To procure a word processor version one would have to contact the contest host for the year of interest. Alternately, conversion back to a word processor version is an alternative, ymmv.

### If you are a host of a contest not represented here

If you will contribute you may pull with git or GitHub, but you might contact Donald G McGahan aka dig-soilman to alert him so that your pull may be approved.
