# SASES Region IV Soil Judging	

SASES - Students of Agronomy, Soils, and Environmental Sciences is the undergraduate student program of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and Soil Science Society of America (SSSA).

Herein are archives of previous contests in Region IV. 

The documents in the archive are to be treated as "works of authorship," and as such, require permissions from the respective authors and citations when referencing them. As "works of authorship" the documents are intended to be distributed and decimated to learners/participants of the Regional Soil Judging Contest events freely and without cost.

## Getting Started

These sources are meant to serve the coaches as they adjust for a given hosting of a judging event. Most are presented in this repository in Portable Document Format (pdf). The portable document format was created for just such a purpose. No effort has been made to update the pdf's to newer encodings so the older versions may be less ADA accessible than the newer versions. Even so they are largely saved as pdf from Microsoft Word and that format also has limitations for ADA Accessabilty that increases moving backward in time.

### Source access

To procure a word processor version one would have to contact the contest host for the year of interest. Alternately, conversion back to a word processor version via pandoc, Acrobat, or other directly from the pdf is an alternative, ymmv.

### If you are a host of a contest and the guide and score card are not represented here consider contrubuting it to this repository.

If you will contribute you may with git or GitHub, but you might contact [Donald G McGahan](https://dig-soilman.github.io) aka dig-soilman to site the repository or to alert him so that your pull may be approved.
